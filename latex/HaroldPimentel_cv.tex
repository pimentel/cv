{\em Research Assistant} \hfill {\bf October 2010 - Present}\\ 
Professor Lior Pachter Lab. Generally focused on method development using
statistics and machine learning for mRNA-Seq technology. Currently working on
identifying incorrect gene annotations, differential expression coupled with
transcriptome abundance estimation, and analysis with biologist collaborators.
Past work: transcriptome mapping, visualizing fragment alignments. Also the
system administrator for the group.

{\em Research Assistant} \hfill {\bf June 2013 - Present}\\ 
Professor Haiyan Huang Lab. Developing methods for biclustering of linear
expression patterns. I am currently working with Prof. Huang to address some
regularization parameter estimation issues in our method, as well as working
with biologists to apply our method to modENCODE RNA-Seq data. In particular,
I've been working with the D. Melanogaster perturbation data set which looks at
85 different experimental conditions.

{\em Research Assistant} \hfill {\bf December 2007 - May 2010}\\
Professor Spiros Courellis Lab. Shake\&wARP electron density map refinement
research project. Deployed a distributed and parallel computing environment used
for Phase Bias Removal in Macromolecular Crystallography. Developed new
techniques for alternative electron density maps, including new methods to
cluster maps based on similarity and returning a new averaged map based on the
most similar maps.
